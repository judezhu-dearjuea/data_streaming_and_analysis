    "## Explanation of Game (game_api.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our game is a simple multiplayer fighting game. Each player initializes with a set amount of health, money, and a basic weapon (stick). They can purchase another weapon with their money or purchase a shield to limit their damage intake. To get more money, they can \"dig for gold\". A player attacks other players with their weapon with the hope of killing the other players (bringing their health to 0). If they are successful in killing another player, they inherit all of the other player's money.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of function calls:\n",
    "- /initialize\n",
    "    - Person calls this to initialize a new player in the game with a given username. The player is initialized with 100 money, 20 health, a stick (weapon) and no shield.\n",
    "    - The event is logged to Kafka.\n",
    "- /purchase_weapon\n",
    "    - Person calls this to purchase a weapon in the game with their given username and desired weapon. There are checks for validity of username and weapon, aliveness of player, and sufficiency of money. If purchase is successful, the appropriate money is subtracted from the wallet, and the new weapon is stored for the player.\n",
    "    - Types of Weapon: Price, Damage, Success Rate of Weapon\n",
    "        - Stick: 0, 0, 1\n",
    "        - Knife: 5, 2, 0.7\n",
    "        - Sword: 10, 3, 0.65\n",
    "        - Grenade: 15, 5, 0.4\n",
    "        - Gun: 50, 9, 0.75\n",
    "        - Bazooka: 100, 20, 0.5\n",
    "        - Nuke: 500, 100, 1\n",
    "    - A successful purchase is logged to Kafka.\n",
    "- /purchase_shield\n",
    "    - Person calls this to purchase a shield in the game. There are checks for validity of username, aliveness of player, and sufficiency of money. If purchase is successful, the appropriate money is subtracted from the wallet, and the player is equipped with a shield.\n",
    "     - Shield costs 20 and limits the damage of attacks by 5.\n",
    "     - A successful purchase is logged to Kafka.\n",
    "- /dig_for_gold\n",
    "    - Person calls this to \"dig for gold\" or get more money. There are checks for validity of username, aliveness of player, and sufficiency of money to purchase a shovel to \"dig for gold\". If purchase is successful, the player digs for gold. A random distribution determines the amount of gold the player will receive, and this amount is added to the player's wallet. Digging for gold costs 5.\n",
    "     - A successful \"dig for gold\" event is logged to Kafka.\n",
    "- /attack\n",
    "    - Person calls this to attack another player. There are checks for validity of both usernames and aliveness of players. The attack has a chance of success based on the player's weapon. If the attack is successful, the enemy player's health is reduced by the player's weapon's damage rate. If the enemy has a shield, the damage rate is reduced by 5 health. The enemy player is killed if their health reaches 0. If the enemy is killed, the player inherits all of the enemy's money in their wallet.\n",
    "    - A successful attack is logged to Kafka.\n",
    "    - A failed attack is logged to Kafka.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus (Redis)\n",
    "We use redis to track the player state and store their data in the game. We use redis as a distributed, in memory key-value storage engine and populate it with different types of keys and values."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "** For each loop **\n",
    "\n",
    "- a random USERID and a random ENEMYID is generated, for example \"user14\". The script bounds the range of USERIDS and ENEMYIDs to between \"user1\" to \"user50\"\n",

    "\n",
    "- if the generated USERID and ENEMYID happen to be the same, another ENEMYID will be generated until these two IDs are distinctive\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the 1st loop, one user and one enemy are initialized to start the game\n",
    "\n",
    "- one of the following actions can be taken by the user based on the random value stored in $STAGE variable\n",
    "\n",
    "     - 11% probability an enemy will be added\n",
    "     - 22% probability a weapon can be purchased. Although game_api determines whether the user has sufficient fund in wallet to purchase the weapon\n",
    "     - 11% probability a shield is purchased, if the user has enough fund\n",
    "     - 45% probability the user will attack the enemy generated at the begging of the loop. We want to increase the frequency of this event because this leads to more interesting analysis.\n",
    "     - 11% probability the user digs for gold 5 times\n",

    "## Explanation of Data Pipeline\n",
    "Here we describe the data pipeline represented by our project starting from data generation at the source to injesting it, to processing it, to storing it, and finally to analyzing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### game_api.py logs events to Kafka\n",
    "The game logs events for at least each of the function calls to Kafka. We utilize the Flask API to log these events as JSONs into the Kafka cluster with an \"events\" topic where the events are published. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Generation\n",
    "We use a shell script with Apache Bench that create a maximum of 50 users in the game with 1000 request call to the game API. The parameters for the requests are randomized as well as the event requests themselves with a set probability. Apache Bench is used in the shell script to execute these randomized requests to generate game events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Consumption\n",
    "We consume and process the raw events with Spark (pyspark) where we stream the events, read them and store them in a Spark dataframe. We then filter the raw events into classified events (weapon_purchase events, gold dig events etc.) with predefined schema into Spark dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Storage\n",
    "After filtering the extracted events into their respective dataframes, we write them to HDFS as Parquet files.\n",

    "We read from the Parquet files in HDFS using Spark dataframes and publish the data into external tables (schema-on-read) using Hive.\n",

    "### Presto Analysis\n",
    "We query the external tables with Presto for analysis of the events in the tables. We answer the business analysis questions in this final step."
